<!-- this is template of custom DeedPlanner database file. You can use it to easily transfer your custom entites between the DeedPlanner versions. This might be useful for future PMK's, Wurm Unlimited servers or people who want to keep DeedPlanner database up to date before official patch will come live. -->
<!-- you can copy and rename this file - as long as its format is xml and name starts with "objects", it will be loaded by DeedPlanner. -->
<!-- it is good practice to also keep custom models/textures in new folder inside the "Data" folder - keep in mind that models and textures inside "official" folders can change without any warning, so assets inside custom folders should be self-contained. -->
