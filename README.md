You should be able to compile the application using any IDE with Maven support, but to visually edit GUI's you should use the NetBeans.

<b>Project goals:</b><br>
1. Creation of the most advanced, professional-looking deed planner for Wurm Online and Wurm Unlimited<br>
2. Access to the widest possible audience - as little platform-dependent code as possible (support for Windows, Linux and Mac systems)<br>
3. The program usage should be as simple as possible<br>
4. Cooperation with other Wurm-related programs and the game itself.
